:description: This section describes how to do the actual import of data with Neo4h Data Importer.
= Import

Once the files are provided, the data model complete, and all elements mapped, the import can be run.
However, you can _preview_ your data at any time and make sure that everything is mapped the way you expect before you run the actual import.

[[preview]]
== Preview

The preview button is located next to the _Run import_ button and unlike running the import, the preview does *not* require an active connection.

When you run a preview, only a sample of the provided data is scanned.
This means that the preview can differ from the final import in terms of connectedness, for example.
Even so, the preview can be very useful to get an overview of the data, especially on smaller datasets.

Since the preview does not actually import any data, it can be run iteratively until you are satisfied.

The preview shows a sample of all data that is mapped _correctly_ in the model.
Unlike the actual import, the preview can be run regardless of the completeness of the mapping.
If any element is missing the green checkmark in the model, it will _not_ be included in the preview, but the preview can still be run.

[[run-import]]
== Run the import

When you are happy with the model and the mapping is complete, the import can begin.
But before starting the import, it is important to make sure Data Importer is connected to the database.
This is done in the connection dropdown located in the top center of the UI.

// Add something about the DB switcher here, when that is available.

The _Run import_ button shows the progress of the import when you press it.
The import is done in batches and can be stopped at any time.

When the import stops, whether because it is complete or because it was cancelled, a summary is displayed.
The summary contains information about the imported nodes and relationships, including time elapsed, the file size, the number of properties etc.
The results summary also allows you to see the Cypher statement used to load a particular file.
It is not advisable to copy and paste these statements, but seeing them can provide valuable insight into how constraints are created and how load statements are constructed.

For nodes, there are two statements, a _key statement_ and a _load statement_.
The key statement is concerned with creating a constraint to ensure the uniqueness of the nodes.
The load statement creates nodes for every item in the mapped file and adds the assigned properties from the data model.

For relationships, there is only a load statement.
It finds the start (source) and end (target) nodes and creates a relationship between them and sets the assigned (if any) properties to the relationship.
